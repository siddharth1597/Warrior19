The Android Application which helps to track the vacant Beds/Ventilators i the hospitals which provides covid19 treatment.

Brief Description: In current scenario, the people cannot find the right hospitals, to go in hour of need so it might be the risk for the society as well as the life of that person. 
So, we have came with an idea to develop an Android application which tracks the status of empty beds and ventilators in the nearby hospitals providing the corona treatment.

For this,

Prerequisites: The data of vacant beds and ventilator in hospitals which are providing the corona treatment, but for now we will be using the dummy data for the development, so that we can show the demo.

Working: There are 2 modules of this application, one for hospitals and another is for user.

For hospitals, 
1. The registered hospitals would be given permission to access the application. 
2. For the information, the hospitals needs to update the data frequently of current situation.

For users,
1. The users can see the nearby hospitals with the information of availability of beds.

Technology used: Android, Google location API, Firebase.
