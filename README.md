The Android Application which helps to track the vacant Beds/Ventilators in the hospitals which provides covid19 treatment.

# Short Description

## What's the problem?
During this pandemic covid19 we are seeing so many sad news where people are rushing here and there to find out the hospital for the patient and during this search the most painful event occurs where someone’s near and dear loses life.

## How can technology help?
This an Android application, Android being an OS which nowadays everyone is using , Thus making this technology
•	Easy to use
•	User friendly
•	Being a tracker, this could help the user not only to find out the hospitals but also track the availability of beds and resources
•	 At hospital end , this increases the employment as well hospital patient interaction.

Technology used: Android, Google location API, Firebase.

## The idea
The app Warrior 19 plays an important role by helping people in not only to locate the hospitals but also to ensure availability of beds and ventilators.

The approach is pretty simple.Wehave two interfaces one for hospital side and other for user to operate. Hospital responsible to frequently update the data each night. The citizen can check the frequent updates of the beds and ventilators available near him which he can reach faster and feasibly.


# Long Description
Moving on to the task that each module is assigned to :-
1.Hospital:
1)	Only registered hospitals would be given permission to access the application. 
2)	For the information, the hospitals needs to update the data frequently of current situation.The type of info includes:-
a)	Registration:-
i)	Hospital Name
ii)	Email id :- Required to login
iii)	Password :- Required to login.
b)	Login:-
i)	Through Credentials
ii)	Through Gmail Login
c)	When hospital logins first time it is given permission to edit the following things:-
i)	No of total and the vacant beds.
ii)	No of ventilators and the vacant one,
iii)	Phone number
iv)	Its Available for treatment or not.
d)	Dashboard :- 
i)	Which allows him to see his details of his hospital on Map (including marker on his location))
ii)	Option to edit and update the details which would be reflected on his dashboard as soon as it is changed.
For Users:-
As this thing is an alarming need of today’s scenario , so every user wants to access the details in one click:
We are providing users to view the data in Map View as well as List view.
1.	Map View:
a)	This approach provides the citizen to view its current location and all the nearby hospitals and there status.
b)	He can filter the hospitals according to distance provided.
2.	List of Hospitals can be provided to him under the same filters.

It is well said “What people see you do may not remembered; what they hear you say may be forgotten; but how they fell your intervention in their times of need will forever be remembered”

So a step towards humanity , towards mankind.
